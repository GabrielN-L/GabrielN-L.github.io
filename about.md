<p>I recently graduated from Utrecht University, having completed a master's degree in Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences. I also hold a bachelor's in Mathematics (with First Class Honours) from University of Bath. 
</p>

<p>I am interested in using data to retrieve important information, particularly in the fields of Biomedical Statistics and Bioinformatics. I wrote my MSc thesis at the Julius Centre, UMC Utrecht. The thesis involves the extension of a data integration method. The proposed method, Supervised PO2PLS, aims to enable the combination of two high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics datasets and the simultaneous prediction of a disease indicator.</p>
